# Write a program that: 
# Takes a String, then finds the number of times 'the' appears in the given String, and finally prints:
#
#   "'the' appeared x times"
#
# where x is an Integer.
#
# Use the "sentence" variables below to test your code by uncommenting each sentence and trying to use it
#
# Hint: It may be helpful to use the advanced gsub techniques with the Regexp class; see the Ruby reference: 
#   https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33#advanced-gsub-techniques

# try me 
sentence = "the dog, the cat, the zebra, the giraffe" # x = 4

# then make sure these work as well!
# sentence = "the, the code, and the developer" # x = 3
# sentence = "then the- their" # x = 1

# write your code below
