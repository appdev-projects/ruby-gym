# We have a program to encode our messages, now can you write a way to decode them? 
# Remember our sercret code: a = 1, e = 2, i = 3, o = 4, u = 5.  
# Your program should:
# - take an encoded message
# - decode the message
# - print the decoded message.
#
# Make sure each of these secrets outputs the correct decoded response
